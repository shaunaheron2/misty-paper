<p>We fitted a Bayesian linear mixed model (estimated using MCMC sampling with 4 chains of 4000 iterations and a warmup of 1000) to predict robot_trust_post with group, nars_pre_c and native_english (formula: robot_trust_post ~ group + nars_pre_c + native_english). The model included session_id as random effects (formula: list(~1 | session_id, ~1 | trust_items)).

The model’s explanatory power is substantial (R2 = 0.64, 95% CI [0.59, 0.68], adj. R2 = 0.61) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.16 (95% CI [0.03, 0.29]).

The model’s explanatory power is substantial (R2 = 0.44, 95% CI [0.35, 0.51], adj. R2 = 0.39) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.10 (95% CI [0.01, 0.19]).
